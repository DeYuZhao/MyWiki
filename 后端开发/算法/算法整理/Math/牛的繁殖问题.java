 * @description
 * Cows in the FooLand city are interesting animals. One of their specialties is related to producing offsprings. A cow in FooLand produces its first calve (female calf) at the age of two years and proceeds to produce other calves (one female calf a year).
 *
 * Now the farmer Harold wants to know how many animals would he have at the end of N years, if we assume that none of the calves die, given that initially, he has only one female calf?
 *
 * explanation:At the end of 1 year, he will have only 1 cow, at the end of 2 years he will have 2 animals (one parent cow C1 and other baby calf B1 which is the offspring of cow C1).At the end of 3 years, he will have 3 animals (one parent cow C1 and 2 female calves B1 and B2, C1 is the parent of B1 and B2).At the end of 4 years, he will have 5 animals (one parent cow C1, 3 offsprings of C1 i.e. B1, B2, B3 and one offspring of B1).
 *
 *
 * Input
 * The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each line of the test case contains a single integer N as described in the problem.
 *
 *
 * Output
 * For each test case print in new line the number of animals expected at the end of N years modulo 10^9 + 7.
 *
 *
 * Sample Input 1
 * 2
 * 2
 * 4
 * Sample Output 1
 * 2
 * 5
